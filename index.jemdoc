=== Ph.D. Student, [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ EECS U.C. Berkeley] \n
I am a seconnd year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley advised by [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/ Prof. Jitendra Malik]. Before coming here, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, where I worked with [http://www.manikvarma.org/ Dr. Manik Varma] and [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/  Dr. Prateek Jain] on developing Resource Efficient Machine algorithms. I am broadly interested in Robotics, with a focus on developing efficient deployable algorithms for navigation. I completed my undergraduate study at Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, with a major in Computer Science and Engineering. My Bachelor's Thesis was advised by [http://home.iitj.ac.in/~goravb/ Dr. Gaurav Bhatnagar].
